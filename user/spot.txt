@FSpot @E(Intelligence)@H

Helps you notice secrets when you are not actively searching for them, often
from a distance.  Unlike @Isearch@H skill you need to be able to see.

How does this work?

You enter a room, lay your eyes on something that is door in disguise, hidden
trap or a monster hiding underneath an item.  Then you may either notice
something is off and the secret is no longer so secret for you or you may
overlook it.  You do get second chances at this but only ater long time passes
so putting quite a bunch skill points here may be a life-saver at times.
