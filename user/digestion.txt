@LDigestion @E(Constitution) @J(Translation)@H

You can eat and digest virtually anything without incurring any side
effects bad or good.  This power comes with super flexibility to eat
items that you have equipped but consuming worn eyewear, worn helmets
and installed cranial bionic implants is going to be difficult until
they are removed.  Mainly useful to get rid of some buggy stuff.

However, it has been observed you can get @Esick@H from eating floppy
@Cdisks containing viruses@H for some bizarre reason.

If you have at least @C3 skill points@H in this power your tongue can
become briefly long enough to @Csnatch worn eyewear@H with ease.

To make your tongue have enough force to @Ctake off worn helmet@H you
need to have at least @C6 skill points@H in digestion.
