@LImbue @E(Psionics) @J(Creativity)@H

Imbue differs from most other continuous powers.  While it takes @Cno points
for activation@H they are @Cexpended each attack@H instead.  If you run out of
Psionics in combat while Imbue is working it will be silently deactivated.

While this power is active you channel some Psionic energy through wielded
or thrown weapon increasing damage output and for thrown items hit chance.
Fighting unarmed also triggers this effect.

In @Cmelee@H this costs @Cone point@H while at @Crange@H it requires @Ctwo points@H.

Damage bonus: skill / 2, but no less than 1 and no more than 8
To hit bonus (thrown): equal to skill, but no less than 1 and no more than 10
