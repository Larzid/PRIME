implants

  I'm thinking a player can have 3-4 cranial implants at a time?
  Maybe some character classes have more slots than others...

  can be installed in different locations

  target computer         (+2 ranged attack)
  health monitor          (gives low hitpoint warning)

  skill soft              (+10 to a given skill)

  babel fish              (translate)

  if you're wearing implants, need to take ibuprofin all the time?

IDEAS:

software license expires after a certain time period forcing reinstallation
can be cracked / pirated, but watch out for license enforcer droids!
corrupt software - doesn't work right, 22% chance of viral infection!
weapons / armor can be booby-trapped

communicator -
 combined with business cards allows you to contact various resources:
  guild:            you start with this number
  pizza station:    order a pizza into the dungeon!
  galactic library: access to spoilers (Nethack Oracle style)
  
central power store, recharged with energy cells 

 It's totally annoying to the player if she has to manually recharge
 power-using items all the time.  Especially low-consumption items
 like the health monitor.

 Should the player require a main power distribution item?  probably.
 but brings up the possibility that it could be stolen or destroyed,
 seriously screwing the player over!  I suppose wise players would
 have a backup power plant?  Nethack players have the same problem
 with bags of holding (sortof). 

 Or perhaps batteries in main inventory should just automatically
 beam their energy whereever needed.  Maybe always drain the battery
 that's closest to empty?  Even this would be an inventory management
 annoyance, because you'd have to keep dropping the spent batteries.

 Heck, now I'm thinking energy cells should be treated just like
 buckazoids - inventory management is completely abstracted away!
 I'll make energy cells a bit on the heavy side so the player can't
 just hoard them, and will seek out more advanced energy production and
 distribution items (such as Mr. Fusion).

GUILDS:

    - hero can join 1 or more guilds.  membership fee is required (200 * character level),
       and must be renewed whenever you gain a character level.

    - can be contacted via communicator:
       "Your membership has expired.  Renew now for the low price of (200 * character level)?"
       "how may we be of service?"
         "transport away (100 buckazoids)"
         "nanoparamedic repair (500 buckazoids)" 
         "bug scan (400 buckazoids)"
           - fixes buggy items
         "object identification (50 buckazoids)"
           - this might make it too easy, perhaps reserve it for merchants only
    - service prices may be modified according to alignment
    - will occasionally call upon you to complete a special quest, and reward
      you with an artifact or something cool if you succeed.

 L33T Software Pirates
   Arrr!!
   alignment good: hacking software, stealing from shops
   alignment bad: buying software in the shop, getting arrested
   membership benefits: hacking skill focus

 Space Communists
   good: spreading communist propaganda, converting
   bad: spending money
   membership benefits: communist propaganda access and skill focus
    - no membership fee!
    - communism is spread through the propaganda skill (neuralyze em first
      for best results).  A successful skill check will convert the subject
      and render them peaceful.  If Hero is converted, a deprogramming pill
      can be used to remove the brainwashing.

 Anti Droids (hate AI)
   good: destroying droids
   bad: using or training droids
   membership benefits:

   good: killing enemies
   bad: running away, bribing enemies, peaceful solutions

GAME BALANCE

  corpses
    - dead monster should leave corpse behind?
    - corpses that aren't cleaned up could cause problems:
        in high-security areas, alerts the guards
        attracts carrion eating monsters
    - but don't burden the player with the task of cleaning up the
      dungeon all the time because that would be really boring!

  time pressure
    - there has to be a compelling reason not to stand around doing nothing.
      This game should not reward the typical boring RPG-style
      stat-gain/level-up oriented play of killing the same kind of monster
      and/or repeating a mundane task over and over.
      (starvation /thirst danger, monsters get tougher by the round, guild
      fees unaffordable unless you keep delving deeper?)  radiation poisoning
      might be a good motivator at lower levels.  At high levels, this might
      be more difficult since the Hero will be a total badass.  How about giving
      the Hero a time limit to finish the game, because the space hulk is about 
      to fall into a black hole or crash into a gas giant or something?

  guilds
    - optional
    - emergency escape for low level characters, but costs money
    - low and mid-level characters will enjoy quest opportunity
    - high level advantages?
    - communism is the subversive guild

$ buckazoids are hard to find in early levels
    - can be used to buy equipment in occasional shops
    - can be used to buy guild membership and exercise services
    - can be used to bribe certain enemies?
    - character net worth per level?

  radiation protection is important to get early on
    -rad-away canisters cleanse your system
    -canister of restoration can repair damage
    -geiger counter detects radiation 
    -rad suit, combat armor prevent exposure 
    -occasional monsters use radiation weapons against you
    -certain traps radiate you
    -certain areas radiate you without any immediate clue!
    -every 10 seconds, radiation level is checked; you take some number of rads
      for every source that affects you
    -every 100 seconds, if rads > 50, make con check or 
      a while later, "you have a headache!", "you feel sick!", etc. 
       Con damage racks up until you die. 
    -radiation exposure has a small chance of inducing mutations /
      psionic powers (the radioactive canister of mutagen is a much better way)
    -radiation will blank floppy disks.  "You notice the label on one of your
      floppy disks has peeled off"  A good clue that you're in a radioactive
      area is that all the floppy disks are blank.




  identifying items is a big pain
    -the identify software is common and cheap in shops, but you'll have
     to survive long enough to make it to a shop!
    -maybe things can be identified by throwing them into a garbage incinerator
     (or through some other destructive process)
    -can be tried on or used, and hope you get lucky.

  an annoying monster at early level keeps regenerating until you can
  eradicate its corpse somehow:
    - scrubbot will clean it up
    - mop will too
    - disintegration beam
    - throw its corpse into a garbage incinerator, down the stairs, 
      or through a trap door?
    - superdigestion mutant power will let you eat it

  droids
    - a lot tougher than the low-level hero
    - require restraining bolt to tame
    - don't heal damage on their own; must be repaired with skill (and spare parts?)
    - even when reduced to 0 hp can still be repaired; 
    - destroyed beyond repair at -10 hp, or by annihilation, vaporization, etc
    - might go haywire?
    - repairing a disabled (0 hp) hostile droid will make it peaceful
    - drink beer for fuel (Futurama joke)
    - spare parts needed to make a droid: (?)
        - servo actuator
        - motivator
        - asimov circuits
        - armor plating
        - 

  good armor is hard to find at early levels

  what to do about one-handed / two-handed weapons?
    - should there be a shield?
    - dual wield light saber and laser pistol
    - -2 penalty to hit when shooting pistol with only one hand?

  experience
    - earned for defeating monsters:  XP = 2^((ML - PL) / 2) * 100
    - earn 1000 XP, gain a character level

  skills
    - repair is quite handy for maintaining useful droids 
       requires a monkey wrench or duct tape
    - communication is quite handy unless / until you find a Babel Fish
    - weapon skills (obviously) improve combat effectiveness

    - Advancement is based on exercise.  Each successful use of a
      skill earns a number of points.  Collect a number of points
      equal to 10 * (1 + current ranks), and you earn a new rank.
      This means to have 20 ranks requires a total of 2100 pts.  Can't
      have more ranks in a skill than 1 + your CL.

           ranks   points
           1       10
           2       30
           3       60
           4       100

           8       360
           9       450
           10      550

      * communication  ex 10 pts. per use
      * hide           ex 1 pt per monster that doesn't notice you
      * listen         ex 2
      * move silently  ex 1
      * repair         ex 10
      * spot           ex 1
      * search         ex 3
      * weapon         ex 1, 5 for critical hit
      * medicine       ex 10

    - A character can only earn a certain number of ranks per level
      (depends on your class)
    
weapon skills:

simple melee weapons  (knife, club, probe, tazer)
swords (katana, light saber)
grenades
handguns (pistol, phaser)
light guns (shotgun, blaster, rifles)
heavy guns (pulse rifle, boltgun)

ray guns (no skill)




  the ability to survive in a vacuum is required mid-game         
    - sudden decompression can occur in some areas
    - require spacesuit and space helmet or better
    - vacuum causes death in a few seconds (but is not an instadeath)
 
  coping with antigravity is also required by mid-game
    - magnetic boots
    - jetpack
    - spacesuit is not enough

NEW SPEED SYSTEM PROPOSAL:

the game is played in rounds.
Every round:
  * the Clock is incremented
  * some AP are awarded to each creature according to its speed.
    The typical award is 100 AP + 5 * agility_bonus.
  * any creatures that have accumulated positive AP can take a turn
  * Most actions cost 1000 AP
  * canisters of speed should 

every 100 pts of speed correspond to doubling of speed


PLOT

The center of our galaxy is a dangerous place.  Gigantic stormy
nebulae and gargantuan swallow starships and even entire worlds.
Wormholes and other openings into warpspace ..

You have piloted a small starship deep into Sector Z in search of the
most famous of the derelict hulks, Argonaptigon.  A colony ship from
ancient Arth, it was lost a thousand years ago.  But rumors on the
subspace nets claim it has been found again.  Surely there must all
kinds of glittering riches there to plunder!!

The journey has been perilous.  After a harrowing laser battle with
some space pirates, you were forced to crash land on a large
asteroid.  Your spaceship is ruined, 


version 0.1 dungeon layout:

12 regular levels
1 secret hideout level


version 0.2 proposed dungeon layout:

4 regular levels
town level       - 90% chance of computer for sale here
6 regular levels
arena level
2 prison levels
4 cave levels
3 secret hideout levels

current dungeon layout

15 regular levels, town on level 8
6 cave levels branch from town


possible dungeon layout

level 1 just below surface after first airlock
2-4 levels of ruined corridors, mostly abandoned
A crossroads town level (two ways down from here)
 > 2-3 levels with lots of robots
   droid fortress level, HAL 9000 (radiation hazard)
   2-4 ruined corridors
   1-3 biolab levels (radiation hazard)
   motherbrain (has some nifty item)

1-3 corridor levels
library level with computer terminal
1-3 corridor levels
 > 4 minesweeper levels (with a nifty prize at the end)
2-4 corridor levels

 
10-15 radiation waste levels

* 'r'eload command (same as quiver in nh)

* coffee canister (sleep immunity)

* should pulse rifle have integrated grenade launcher??

* maybe get rid of energy cells altogether and just have different power plants?

* nasty monster list: 
    usenet troll (so the poor hero might get a computer if she needs one)
    gray

* too much teleportation should have consequences... warp rift? gate in demons?
* earn XP for finding secret stuff?
* named implants should appear with description

* mainframe computer that's too heavy to pick up

* "your shot misses something" - should be no message

* Zombie process monster which can't be killed until parent is destroyed

  zombie is indestructible except with silver weapons

* more monster spellcasters (lawyer?)
* process spellcasters 

* floppy disk of spawn process (creates flying toasters)
