** move attacks, flavor, items, lore, monsters .txt  into  mods/prime
** add to config: mod = mods/prime/
** move gfx/ into mods/prime/gfx/
** move lua/ into mods/prime/lua/
 == instantly bill your selves as having a fully modable game

** add to config: mod-base = mods/prime/
** add some clever logic to fopen() so that files not found in, say,
<mod>/lua are looked up and read from <mod-base>/lua
 == instant acclaim for an easy to use modding system :)


** add docs/licenses/  and populate at will.
** add docs/license.txt    .. you might as well
** add docs/building.txt   .. some info on dependencies wouldnt hurt
** add stuff like
