Hahaha, good to hear that!

Hey, one good thing to have for ninjas would be some sort of vest that can
be worn over the jumpsuit without blocking camouflage. Puny armor, but at
least would allow them to wear SOMETHING over the jumpsuit.

Attribute shifting sounds very good :)

Everything sounds very solid. When there vat dries up as you come out of
it, the game should print a message along the lines of "*the vat drains out
the spent sludge" *

TDTTOE:

Here are a variety of potential conflicts while inside a vat for you to
ponder :)

If damaged bio-equipment is worn and a restoration effect triggers, the
bio-equipment should "steal" the restoration effect from the player and get
healthier.

If the player vomits inside the vat, he should become sickened on top of
radiation sick (vomiting inside a liquid you're floating in is just
gross) *"You
can see bits of your last lunch/dinner/breakfast floating around! Ewwww"*

Being inside a tank could prevent quaffing *"your mouth is too busy with
the respiration apparatus"*. This measure could prevent abuse of
submerging+quaffing. Likewise, going into a tank with a canister stuck to
your tongue should be either impossible or incur drowning damage.

Trying to operate energy tanks, transfer cables or tesla equipment inside a
vat should be either impossible "Come to think of it, doing that now really
is a bad idea" or incur shocking damage and energy loss.

Similar with freezing weapons: Either bad idea, or freeze damage and
immobilization for several turns.

Flamers can't be operated inside a vat.

Conventional weapons, plasma, laser, heat rays work as intended, maybe with
a chance for misfiring. Antimatter annihilates the vat from the inside.

When resurrecting in a QR chamber, the player could appear not only naked
but also inside a vat. Nakedness should be listed as a status in the
sidebar (even if it doesn't do anything by itself, just so the player
notices and for the evulz)
