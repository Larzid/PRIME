PLASMA:
We have plasma weapons (which I introduced) and plasma canisters
(since ZAP'M), which are WHOLLY UNRELATED.

What about making plasma weapons chargeable with plasma canisters?

9 charges for pistols, 6 for rifles and 3 for cannons.

That could make them fire "supercharged" shots in the presence of an
energy source, or normal shots in its absence.

AFAIK the only uses for plasma canisters are:

Abortion
Making gauss ray guns (which are pretty damn awesome, if
a bit restricted in their uses)
Tossing them at monsters if you implemented their explosion.

More a matter of coherence than anything.

TDTTOE: The bio computer shoud *at least* be partially
resistant to gaussing. You could make it vulnerable to
poison instead, like bio armors.

Hahahah awesome. Could you make it so that drinking napalm afterwards
results in instadeath?

You know, who in the right mind would drink napalm right after fuel?

(someone who just drank fuel to get rid of an alien and then desperately
quaffs everything looking for a canister of restoration/radaway/whatever)




BELT:
When trying to forcibly remove:
You exert your abdominal muscles and a thunderous noise reverbs
throughout the [room/corridor/cave/sewer/town/weird mainframe desc]

(Alert monsters, if wearing a sealed helmet, make player sickened until
removed)


GHOSTS:
My bad about the protoss ghost. It seemed cool, but yeah, you're right.
See, that's why it's better if you take care of protoss lore and stuff - I
may very well fumble on my way. Space elves are out of the question for a
similar reason - they store their souls in gemstones upon death or slaanesh
eats them.

Ghosts:
attack: they might *flail away at you with their cold, cold hands.*

Yeah, tombs should be pretty rare. I was thinking a range of 1~3 per game,
taking the sith tomb into account. The sith tomb could be one place where
digging comes in handy: the door could have a special sith requirement
(similar to the retina scanner) and to loot the tomb as the first part of
the sith quest you'd have to dig your way into it.

Coherent holes would be quite !!FUN!! if they happen to be accidentally dug
on top of any tomb (slim chance, though)





DRESSING:
LooksLikeNinja (chameleon suit, katana, goggles):

"*Halt! Rogue agents not allowed to enter the premises of Robot Town
burbclave!"
"The guardbot beeps and screeches intimidatingly"
*
Door locks, you can't pay a fee for entrance, upon opening of the door the
guardbot becomes hostile - any ninja stupid enough to *look like one* upon
entering a guarded place is in over his head.

Getting out of sight of the guardbot allows the player another check - you *
can* go back and disguise yourself.

Snow Crash reference.

MegaBelterBonus: If the player tries to change his/her appearance in sight
of the guardbot:
*"I don't buy it, punk! You just changed in front of me."
"The guardbot clicks and whirrs in exhasperation".*

> Also, we talked about looks-like-<someone> part of PRIME. Thanks to your
> drawing skills I can make your portrait change to one of appropriate class
> when you fulfill the requirements.

ACID SPLASH:
Acid splashes could have other effects besides damaging the player.

Hitting in melee range always splashes the player.

Hitting from afar might change one tile adjacent to the alien:

floor tile: 50% to turn into a pit

pit tile: 25% to turn into a hole, 25% to turn into an acid pit. (this
should also be checked for an alien bleeding inside a pit)

Queens could have those percentages doubled.



AMMO:
> Hmm. How about EM rounds, toxin rounds and hollow rounds? The former would
> make good anti-robot asset, next would help against living targets. The
> last simply assures no damage done.

Sounds pretty good! But if with "hollow" you mean rounds that don't actually
shoot anything, just make a blast of sound, I think they're called "blanks"
in english. At least that's what I've always thought, we need to do the
research or it might induce confusion in our players.



CLERKBOTS:
> EM rounds would be permitted in weapons shop only if it has a guard or
> this is Robot Town where external support can be summoned.
>
>
Make the guardbot at the entrance charge an additional insurance fee for
controlled hardware.
Something like $3- $10 per EM round. If you put this, gauss rayguns should
incur an additional (higher) insurance fee ($25-$50 *per charge?*).

Plasma guns are okay because they have a wider scope of uses, but quick
decommission of robots is pretty much the only use for EM rounds and gauss
rayguns.



DRAGOONS:
Hey, remember the rejected protoss tomb?

No ghost. No traps No loot. Just a yellow D.

That's, of course, a Dragoon: a shooty, shielded, killing machine.

It's funny how it's a concept very similar to Daleks: A physically unfit
alien interred in a mechanical "body". Were daleks shielded too?

Even funnier how there's another contraption which follows the same concept
and starts with D: Dreadnoughts from WH40k. (just with a mutant human
inside)


So that D monster class could be expanded in the future to Dalek, Dragoon
and Dreadnought. Which one should be tougher I guess it's up for debate.

The dalek is brown/dark yellow I think, the Dragoon and Dreadnought could
be bright yellow and really any other color (Aquamarine Dreadnought more
close combat, Mean Green Dreadnought more shooty?)

MegaBelterBonus: Dragoons aren't slow but move like grid bugs, to reflect
how f*cking bad they go around obstacles in SC1 thanks to that odd thing of
not even turning around. Although they do move in diagonals in SC. Well,
whatever, no need to do this.



DREADNOUGHTS:
> Why not! Need to look up what weapons would be appropriate for
> Dreadnoughts.
>

So far I've seen them employing the following:

Power fist (just give it a nasty crushing attack or whatever)
Laser cannons
Plasma cannons
Rocket launchers (which we don't have)
Fusion cannons (which we don't have)
Assault Cannons (we can give them a heavy machinegun instead)

Any arm with a power fist instead of a heavy weapon is also supplemented
with either a flamer or an assault bolter (I think it's an assault bolter,
that
should be an assault rifle for us)

Hmm. Should we even have rocket launchers? It's a pretty common trope.



BASE FEATURES:
Elevator:

This one came to mind after reading some talk, maybe rgrd? about prime
still having staircases whiel being sci-fi. Well, it's not a substitute
for stairs.

Elevators shafts that span 7 levels, and can carry you from the 2nd to the
6th.

The trick is that you have to activate them on their bottom level. Or maybe
being able to use them right away is good enough since going 5 levels
straight down puts you damn out of depth.

See attachment for diagrams.

Place it wherever it doesn't oblliterate any staircase, then delete
any rooms it would overlap? Or don't delete them, let's just have them
irregular shaped.

Generator room:

A smal room with a machinery tile. If you fix it by applying tools,
unlit rooms in the same level (what about the levels above and
below?) light up. If you break it, lights go out.

Server room:
Same as above, but dealing with computer terminals rather than
lights.

Ventilation ducts:

single-level branches filled with criss-crossing corridors that connect
two branches horizontally (e.g. one exit to a sewers level and another
one to a space base level of equivalent depth).

Should be unlit, filled with i monsters and the occasional A, and their
placement chosen at random at dungeon generation.

Yes, fans sound pretty interesting.

In some ways they would work the opposite to doors:

They could harm you AND prevent passage while working properly (*You tackle
the fan! [1-4] of its blades slashes you! *player remains in the same
square) but do no damage AND allow passage when blocked (item or greater
than some certain size in the fan tile,)

Really, all these ideas are about making the dungeon more interconnected
and "whole" and less a collection of discrete levels.



ABOUT ORCS:
As you can see, I got a little bit... creative when drawing the orcs.

See, sci-fi orcs are usually presented as some sort of stand-in for
politically incorrect, dangerous (or apparently so) social and racial
minorities, troublemakers, misfits.

So I decided to keep that but taking a distance from the usual
biker / punk / skinhead slurry of WH40K orks , and depict some
more contemporary takes on orcs.

Space Orc as a Chav. Space orc boyz, skulking around the local
unfriendly hab complex, smoking, drinking, wearing tacky
jewelry and making life unpleasant to anybody they decide that
looks funny.

Space Orc Pyromaniac as a sociopathic, get-off-my-lawn redneck.
The close encounter of the third kind you *don't* want to have
when you touch down on an isolated asteroid to have sexy times
with that blueskinned space babe you met at Betelgeuse I.
Territorial, isolationist and homicidal, these space orcs are prone
to having a moonshine still and shouting GET OFF MY PROPERTY

"Leather Dominator" Orc Boss: Okay, there are no orc females,
but who's to say that orcs are completely asexual?
These orcs, although popular and very welcome in the more
sexually liberated polities, where they exhibit a surprisingly
peaceful and friendly behavior, are still orcs and very dangerous
should you somehow cross them. The command capacities
of these orcs are a breakthrough in orcish society, as they tend
to employ a dazzling array of reward and punishment techniques
with their underlings, who are soon mesmerized after a life
of "bonks to da 'ead", the traditional orcish disciplinary measure.

Oh well the Space Orc trousers and boots do look rather skinhead-ish.

hardly represented at all in roguelikes - but if you want to keep them, it's
okay exactly for the same reason: Everything is as big as a 32x32 square.
In fact, scale tends to be reversed: smaller objects and creatures look
comparatively big in RL tiles and vice-versa, big creatures and objects
tend to look rather small.

If you recolor them on the fly, that's a whole new layer of adaptability,
so the picture actually looks far better than I thought.

green death skull for infected floppies

-radiation symbol for gamma/rad
-scorpion stinger for poison?

PROFESSIONS:
> Did I mention I was toying with the idea of modifying Psion profession to
> be of space elf race? No idea what special power they would have.
>
>
Mmmm, I object *in part* to this, let me explain.

I really like the idea of having a more flavorful Space elf psion, what
I do have qualms about is replacing the current psion. It may sound
awkward and is probably quite a bit of work but I'd really prefer a wide
selection on roles and races (nethack/crawl) than agglutinating race
and role (old, thin book D&D) save exceptions.

Of course we can't have reticulan space marines, robot mutants or
yautja detectives - that's plain silly. But we could sort of define
"role slots" that vary depending on race and are not necessarily
available in all combinations (not at all)

Killing machine: Marine - Hunter - Dissident
Crafty warrior: Ninja - Hunter - Abductor - Janitor
Burly guy: Quarterback - Hunter
Survivor: Astronaut - Xel'Naga
Psionic: Psionic - Mastermind
Techie: S. Engineer - Dissident - Janitor
????: Detective

Hunters, dissidents and janitors cover more than one slot.

I'd rather be adding to those lines and have *both* human and
elven psions, with different starting inventories, and varying
ability scores and mutant powers accesibility.



RADZOMBIE:
Whatever happened to the Radiation Zombie?
Just a story flag?

Suggestions:
Whenever the player accumulates rads, gains HP
between 1 and rads dosage. For canister of mutagen this
should rather be between 1/10 and 1/5 the rad dosage.

Whenever intelligence takes damage, it has a chance (1/3)
to take double damage; whenever intelligence is healed it
has a chance (2/3) that the amount healed is halved. 1 pt
heal minimum.
(...feral ghouls)

A radiation zombie with 0 int doesn't die until a rad check
is made, then a message is printed along the lines of:
*"Having lost your mind, you wander the (zone name)
aimlessly for years to come"*

I'm not sure if you ended up glowing when very heavily irradiated
or that's just Crawl :P but if you do then the stat line should
change from "rad ghoul" or "rad zombie" to "Glowing One"


MEGA COMPUTER:
I'd rather see a "backpack" slot for that.

We could make powerplants worn on that same slot, so you can't
have a mega computer AND a powerplant.

What for? Mutual equipment exclusion (hey that sounds like a certain
doctrine)

If you're wearing Power Armor, you can't wear a backpack: power armors
almost always have already some sort of powerpack built in the back.

(That could be an additional difference between energy tanks and
powerplants: you *can* use energy tanks with a power armor, say,
fastened to your belt, you *can't* use power plants with power armor
because they're so bulky an unwieldy that you have to strap them to
your back (devote your backpack slot)

So, you can't have power armor AND powerplant, or megacomputer AND
powerplant, or power armor AND mega computer.

We could also introduce a "rugged backpack" that lets you store say,
10 small-to-medium items to protect them from fire/freeze/electricity.

We'd need THREE variants then: lit, unlit, and broken.
unlit: needs generator repair and will automatically lit up when the
generator is repaired.
broken: needs to be repaired on the spot, and possibly bringing a generator
back online.



POWER ARMOR:
*CRAZY IDEAS ON POWER ARMOR:*

*Bells and whistles:*
*
*
Flashlight, vision modes, other built-in gadgetry should be present
in power armor suits and power armor helmets following reference
detail.

Fallout power helmet: built-in flashlight

Space Marine power helmets:
Can you do this with the individual item properties thing?:
Randart.
Each space marine helmet has a chance for granting
one goggles/gizmo type utility, together with all it's usual costs
or lack thereof. Should be biased in favor of combat stuff (scouting,
targeting) and against ninja stuff (x-ray). The pool should be selected
carefully (making them able to substitute *some* goggles and
gizmos but not all)

Terran Marine armor if you include it should have a flashlight, for
sure... and a damn stimpack! :D (the kind that makes you shoot
faster and damages you, not the kind of stimpack that heals you)

Space helmet needs a lot of kBlinding resistance if it doesn't have it
already.

*Restrictions:*

Right now, power armor seems too "cheap" - it's almost a life
insurance when you find it (unless you have really few hitpoints).

But I don't think that making them any less good would do them
justice - they're POWERED ARMOR.

So, I feel it'd be a good idea to add traits that make players "devote"
more of their gameplay if they want to fully enjoy Power Armor.

Fallout style: Power Armor Training. Add an Armor skill that waives
additional penalties  to power armor. Space marines would be
paramount users, followed by astronauts and dissidents in that
order.

Item interdependence: A powered helmet only works properly with
a power armor. A powered helmet only carries it's own weight if
power armor is present - and only then do it's intrinsics and other
functions come online. Properly connecting a power helmet to
a different type of power armor suit requires a successful repair check.

Arcane Penalties: penalties to power-armor performance that require
ifferent in-game remedies to overcome.

*Adeptus Astartes Power Armor*

Pieces:
-Helmet
-Power armor suit
-Black Carapace (mutation and/or implant)


Arcane penalties: if the Black Carapace, a biological interface space
marines use to communicate with their suits, is not present, user
takes agility type additional penalties (to hit, or speed, whatever).
( Other power armor users in WH40k lack this mutation/implant and
as such their use of power armor is comparatively impaired)

Black carapace could give a couple of CON points when used
together with power armor.

*Fallout Power Armor*

Pieces:
-Helmet
-Power armor suit
-Recon armor (slightly armored jumpsuit)

Arcane penalties: if the user isn't wearing recon armor underneath
power armor, s/he gets no strength bonus, and takes a hit to
burning and freezing resistances. (he's going to be either too hot
or too cold inside the armor and can't activate it properly.

The recon armor itself should sport more AC than other jumpsuits
and a little bit of rad resistance.

*Zealot Power Armor*

-Zealot Leg Enhancements
-Zealot armor suit

-Leg enhancements depend on the suit just like helmets.

Arcane penalties: Some benefits scale to PSI.


Chaos and bio armors already have enough unique characteristics.

*Bottom line:*
*
*
Powered armor can easily be over-powered, especially if found
early. I think they'd work better as sets of 2-4 items. To prevent
overabundance of components some of the items worn by enemies
could self-destruct on death (they're coveted technology, and
are rigged with fail-deadly mechanisms), say a 66% chance
for each item to self-destruct on death

Connecting different astartes and/or chaos armor pieces together
should be easiest. Astartes and fallout medium difficulty, and
connecting protoss pieces with anything else the most difficult
since they're alien technology.


PLASMA CASTER, BACKPACK SLOT:
Yeah, the predator plasma caster is mostly unobtrusive, although
we could get finicky on this. We could make things compatible in different
orders. You can first wear a trenchcoat, and THEN strap a powerplant or
shoulder cannon over it, but not the other way around. Or in any case make
the game go through a "remove item A, wear item B, wear item A" routine
as is the case with jumpsuits and armor, if only to make it non-trivial in
combat
(when it *does* matter)

Power armors should be compatible with capes, but not trenchcoats
or backpacks (power plants, mega computer, plasma caster). Backpacks and
capes are incompatible, trenchcoats and capes... not sure. Backpacks and
trenchcoats should be compatible.

Zealot armor should be compatible only with the psionic shield generator -
that is, if the item is still around XD.

An exception should be made if you ever introduce the Power Harness
(technological medium to a third arm), that should be a backpack AND
be compatible with astartes and brotherhood armor (repair check
required for the later)

But if you had the same idea, dude, it has to be done. I'd say you could
even
move two points of AC from the suit to the backpack, it's pretty big.

We'd have to find some use for JUST the powerpack, since "no useless items"

Hmm. "No useless items" is a corollary of TDTTOE, right?

Some more thoughts on SM helmets:

+Psionic amplifier = Librarian Helmet
+Tricorder = Apothecary helmet
