---++ Strength

   * Is key skill for concentration and in future for power armor training
   * Is key skill for metabolic MutantPowers

   * Grants +5 to speed for every 2 points over 10
   * Modifies armor class by (AGI - 10) / 2

---++ Dexterity
   * Is key skill for thrown weapons, handguns, light guns, pick lock and repair
