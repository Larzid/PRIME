Material we could use for references and yet haven't:

Solaris - This is classic, but oscillates between academic, down-to-earth and psychedelic, so might be hard to nail.

Stalker - Even weirder than the above but could justify a Major Wishing mechanic / artifact

Lord of Light ? It's rather obscure but we both have read it. (I vaguely remember stuff about godlike psychic powers, rejuvenation, soul transplant and hindu pantheon impersonation. 

Ringworld - From here can be pulled several monsters (Kzinti could very well be more 'k's, their hat is proud warrior race just as the klingons, Pak Protectors could extend the P category) and some friendly aliens and devices too.

I can't believe we don't have any martians.

Batman - batarang and other bat-stuff.
