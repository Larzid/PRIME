Effects:

Total Dimensional Fatigue value is substracted from translation powers success rate.
   * Every turn, there is a (DF/5)% for a depth-appropriate warpish monster to appear.
   * Every time the DF value is increased, check the new value for a (DF/2)% chance for a depth-appropriate warpish monster to be spawned in a random position.
   * Every time the DF value is increased, check the new value for a (DF/10)% chance for an out-of-depth warpish monster to replace a random monster on the level.
   * Other nasty shit if it's cool enough
   * Under the effects of Spice, the DF value is taken as a bonus rather than a malus to translation power success rate.
