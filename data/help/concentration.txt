@FConcentration @E(Constitution)@H

Helps you sustain any continuous mutant powers you are using when you might
otherwise get distracted.

Chance to fail to maintain an active power when you are being distracted is:

The above nubmer is tested against all your continuous powers in use.

A non-exhaustive list of distractions follows:
 - getting probed in the anus
