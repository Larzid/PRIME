You can actually see radiation!  Items that give off radiation in your 
inventory will be marked green.  Area that is irradiated will be highlighted.

Unless your skill in this power is @C5 points@H or more you will be @Eblinded@H
whenever you are exposed to concentrated radiation.  Walking through
contaminated room is not enough to trigger this but getting hit with gamma
ray gun or rad grenade is.  In Gamma Caves no amount of skill is going to
prevent blindness.
