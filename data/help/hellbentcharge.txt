@LHellbent Charge @E(Constitution) @J(Telekinesis)@H

You rush a short distance and make stronger melee attack.  This does not
guarantee hitting.

If @Cin a pit@H you may charge @Cupwards@H to quickly get out.

You are @Eunable@H to perform this feat when @Eslowed@H, @Esore@H, @Efrightened@H or @Estrained@H
and worse.

To hit modifier: skill / 2 + bonus / 2
To damage modifier: skill / 4 + bonus

Bonus starts from zero (or 3 if you are @Cspeedy@H) and increases by two points
for each square you run.

Range increase is non-linear.  It starts at two:

|  range  |  skill  |
+---------+---------+
|    2    |    0    |
|    3    |    2    |
|    4    |    5    |
|    5    |    9    |
|    6    |   14    |
|    7    |   20    |
