@LAutolysis @E(Constitution) @J(Redaction)@H

You are able to @Csupply@H some of @CPsionic @Ccost@H of using non-continuous
@Fmutant powers@H.  However, the @Cprice@H is paid in your @Chit points@H.

Psionic cost decrease: power_level / 2 + power_level mod 2
Hit point cost: psi_decrease * power_level * power_level

Your @Cskill decreases hit point cost@H to no less than half original value
rounding down.  Ratio is one skill point prevents loss of one hit point.
