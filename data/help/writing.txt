Programming is a difficult activity.  You set out to write a new program
and hope it does not have bugs after you are done.  There are a few things
that affect your success rate:


@FCondition@H                       @Fchance@H             @Fnotes@H
Base chance for success ........  30%
Program complexity .............  -5%   for each full @C20 BZ@H of base cost
Program type is identified ..... +20%
Program type is unidentified ... -20%   (does not affect software engineers)
Blank disk used is @Ebuggy@H ....... -20%
Blank disk used is @Doptimized@H ... +10%
Your programming skill .........  +5%   for each skill point


Note that the chances for success will not include blank disk quality
modifiers unless you know its state.  It is assumed to be debugged
in that case.  Keep in mind this may result in inaccurate prediction.


Your programming skill is influenced by several other factors.  To know
what they are read its information in skill screen help. 


Note: You can cancel writing a program at any time and the blank floppy
disk will stay unused.  However, if you try to specify a program and
fail (due to typo or bad guess) there is 25% chance for the disk to self
destruct.
