@FThrown Weapons @E(Dexterity)@H

This skill helps you hit with all thrown weapons but is especially useful
for grenades.  Your throw range depends on your @EStrength@H and item weight
in most cases.

You can wield @CPulse Rifle@H to use its built-in @Cgrenade launcher@H.  This
will provide you with excellent range and additional two points to hit
chance.  Weapon bugginess also impacts the hit chance.  Firing grenades
with the launcher does not interfere with @LImbue@H mutant power in any way.
