Discipline of manipulating speech to implant a message or order in individual's
subconscous.  The resulting compulsion to obey is strong enough to overpower
one's free will.

Using the power on enemy you will issue a command.  Possible orders:
- You will not read the Nam-Shub!               (forbids computer usage)
- You will not indulge your mutant nature!      (forbids mutant power use)
- You will not show belligerence!               (forbids combat)
- You will not feast upon the poor!             (forces generosity)
- You will not bear petty grudges!              (pacifies offended friendly)

Command chosen is random from the list of those than make sense.

Duration: from 3 up to skill, but never less than 3 turns
