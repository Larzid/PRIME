@LWeb @E(Constitution) @J(Creativity)@H

You can do what Spiderman did!  By bending two of your middle fingers you
release a strand of web at chosen target.  Watch them struggle to get free!
Or better yet waste no time and beat them up while they try to rip the webs
to pieces.

If @Cin a pit@H you may shot the strand @Cupwards@H to lift yourself in a hurry.
This costs @Cone @EPsionics@C point less@H to do.
