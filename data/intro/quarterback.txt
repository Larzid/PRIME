You were thrown into high security prison for beating up your country's sport
and recreation minister when he declared funds for national football
representations are to be cut in half.  You were there when he made the public
announcement.  Everyone was enraged at him, yet seemingly nobody could do
anything about his evil deeds.  Really nobody?   Your nerves snapped. That was
an act on the spot.  This was an act of honor!  You dashed through police cordon
with help of the angry mob.  Next you broke through line of security officers
with aid of your trusted few football co-stars that made it that far.  Finally,
you got to the minister himself.  Boy, did you squash him.  After just a few
seconds of personal contact you left him with a bunch of teeth less and lying
in a small puddle of his own blood.

Then the security used drastic measures to "pacify" the crowd.
Tear gas, tazers, rubber bullets, stun grenades and clubbing.

`You still don't remember?`  The police officer asks mockingly.
`Well *heroname*, for you there are two options,` he continues.
`The electric chair...`, he grins smugly,
`...or something that generates huge viewership.  You could survive in theory.`
The officer bursts into laughter proud of his own joke.

A prison ship shall drop you off on a lone asteroid.  Mysterious "they"
will be tracking your progress by a satellite as you quest for the Bizarro
Orgasmatron.  So far this programme has just generated bloody deaths of 
so-called "main stars" at hands of monsters.  On the other hand you heard
there will be reticulans nearby.  Better for them *not* to be cops ...
because someone certainly *will* suffer your accumulated wrath.
