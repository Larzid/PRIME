Two weeks.  Two weeks trapped inside that damned cargo pod with only
the requisition clerkbot to keep company. And the terrors outside.  You
told him.  YOU TOLD HIM.  Don't buy those damn "krab patties", Johnny.
You don't know what that "krab" is, you never know with these backwater
agriworlds!  He laughed on you.  You told them.  I wouldn't eat those
damn "krab patties" guys, Johnny bought'em off a weird looking yellow guy
in a fishbowl!  They scorned you, and their laughter echoed through the
mess hall.  Go eat your frozen earth shitburgers, they said.  You're being
hypochondriac, these krab patties are awesome - but don't worry, I'll
take yours.  And they laughed.

WELL WHO'S LAUGHING NOW WITH HIS GUTS SPRAYED ALL OVER THE DINNER TABLE,
JOHNNY?!  WHO'S LAUGHING WITH HIS LUNGS OOZING OUT OF HIS EXPLODED CHEST?!!

Not me!  I'm getting out of this graveyard ship, and calling back to command,
however long it takes.  I'm going to be the most frickin' condecorated marine
this side of the Perdus rift.  And your sorry asses will rot in that
MOTHERFUCKING DEATH TRAP FOREVER!!!

So long, bastards.
