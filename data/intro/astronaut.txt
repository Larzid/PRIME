You had been tasked with the first test flight of the Quantum IV
hyperspace engine.  Just as you flew clear of any gravity wells, you
deccelerated and began recording the experiment logs.  Main power
diverted to the prototype engine, all systems green.  All systems?  No!
The flux capacitor displays in red!  Without a second thought, you fasten
your space helmet on, and with an adept kick you deftly propel yourself
to an emergency pod, all the while screaming OH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT
at the top of your lungs.

From a couple miles away, you see the spaceship liquefy and fold into
itself as it's sucked away from within by some sort of warp-hole.
You broadcast what you think are your last words, full with excrement
slang and considerations about the dubious parentage and upbringing
of the shipyard CEO, among other colorful expletives.

After passing out from a panic attack, and through the warp rift, you find
yourself orbiting a derelict asteroid turned space station.  With nothing
to lose except your life, you dock and set out to explore its bowels.
